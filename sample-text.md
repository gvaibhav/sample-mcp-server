# Sample Text for Summarization

This is a sample document that contains some text that can be used to test the summarization functionality of our MCP server. The document discusses various aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most transformative technologies of our time. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and methodologies that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, perception, and decision-making.

Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

The applications of AI and ML are vast and span across numerous industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, entertainment, and many others. These technologies are helping to solve complex problems, automate routine tasks, and create new opportunities for innovation and growth.

However, with great power comes great responsibility. The development and deployment of AI systems raise important ethical considerations around privacy, fairness, transparency, and accountability that must be carefully addressed by developers, researchers, and policymakers.
